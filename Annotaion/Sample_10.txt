This program focuses on electronics as a specialty in the electrical engineering arena. It provides students with up-to-date courses in microelectronics and applications. It covers analysis and design using latest international tools and software adopted by modern industry. The curriculum was designed to include a solid background of the primary electrical engineering areas such as computers, communications, power and control. Students acquire the needed practical skills that go hand in hand with the learned theoretical knowledge in various fields.

The electronics engineering program at PSUT offers students an opportunity to face modern day engineering challenges. The department has partnered with world class international companies to enhance the programâ€™s curriculum. This partnership enables students to use state-of-the-art design software and acquire skills needed to compete in the high technology of the integrated circuits industry. Further, the department sends its high performing students to train in world class design centers to enhance the skills they acquired during their study. In addition, students and faculty of electronics engineering work in close cooperation with the Technology Incubator Park in Al-Hassan Science City to start new entrepreneurial companies in the field of high technology and integrated circuits design and development.

The curriculum is based on 160 credits semester hours. Students usually graduate in five years or less. The program accepts students who succeed in their Jordanian General Secondary Exam/Science Stream, or equivalent, with an average of at least 80%.
