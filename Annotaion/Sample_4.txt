The Department of Computer Graphics and Animation is the first of its kind in Jordan and the region. It aims at providing students with distinguished education in the field of two- and three-dimensional computer graphics. This process is undertaken through focusing attention on the basic mathematical skills in this field. Students are provided with the skills required for using modern techniques and programming in designing graphics and using them in films, educational programs, promotions and computer games, and artistic works.

With the educational plan designed thoroughly to meet the demands of the industry of graphics, there is an emphasis on the practical side through using laboratories and field training in specialized companies. This is designed to produce competent employees able to use modern technology in an optimum way to serve the continuously developing industry worldwide.

The curriculum incorporates a number of courses from the Department of Computer Science, which may establish a solid ground for computer science, such as programming, data structure and data processing. These courses provide a scientific foundation for a better understanding of the objectives of Computer Graphics and Animation.

Courses related to the Computer Graphics and Animation program consist of multimedia programming, drawing, image processing, computer game design and animation, and more. All of the courses are designed to give the students the opportunity to apply theoretical background in practice. Furthermore, the graduation project demonstrates an accumulation of the experiences that the students acquired.
