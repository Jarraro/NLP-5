King Abdullah II Faculty of Engineering at Princess Sumaya University for Technology (PSUT) is among the finest engineering schools in Jordan. We are proud to claim many of the captains of Jordanian industry as our alumni, and I am confident the students, who walk our corridors and fill our classrooms today, will be the leaders of tomorrow.

Our goal is to continue to prepare the future generation of Jordanian engineers to be innovative leaders, and creative problem solvers. Engineering education and research cannot be separated. A strong graduate program is the hallmark of all great Engineering Schools; and PSUT is planning to be one of Jordan’s leading research intensive universities through its newly established Master of Science program in Electrical Engineering. We have completed a long term planning exercise and have identified our strengths and directions for the coming ten years. Over the next few years we will continue this process of self-evaluation, external accreditation, renewal and growth of both our academic programs, staff and our infrastructure.

Our motto is ‘Together we succeed’. I believe strongly in this and I hope that all of you reading this message, our students (past, present, and future),and community supporters will all continue to lend a hand in strengthening one of the best engineering schools in Jordan. I firmly believe that with a clear strategy, and with your support, KAFE at PSUT will continue to grow and change to adjust to the complex demands of the 21st century. In pursuing these opportunities we work with other PSUT Schools and centers, our Alumni, Jordanian industry, and the Government, as we continue to build the reputation of what is already one of Jordan’s finest Engineering Schools. To this end, I encourage you to visit our campus, call or write.
